## How to Contribute ? 

You can : 
1. clone this repository in a local folder
2. create a feature branch to store your changes and improvements
3. provide the aim of the improvement filing out the commit messages
4. Once ready and cleaned your branch commits, you can submit your changes by means of a pull request. 

The pull request will be examined during the RIS WEEK by the temporary Working Group CESNI/TI/ERI by illustrating it into a change request.
Once approved the pull request will be included (merged) into the develop branch by CESNI/TI Secretariat.

## What are the branches ? 

There are 4 types of branches in each repo :
- The main branch that contains only the fully validated (by CESNI) editions
- The development branch that gathers all the development work after it has been validated at the CESNI/TI/ERI level
- The release branch that is derived from the development branch to prepare the validation process to merge with the main branch
- The features branches (typically one for each CR) that derive from the development branch and are used to split the work in small bits

## What are the rules of access and control of the repository ? 

Rules of access of the repository are the following : 
- Merging into the main branch is protected and can be done by the secretariat only, upon decision of CESNI
- Merging into the development branch is protected and can be done by the secretariat only, upon decision of the chair of CESNI/TI/ERI
- No merging into release branch, but this branch is also managed by the secretariat in the validation process of CESNI/TI and CESNI
- No merging into the current feature branches
- However, anybody can “create” features branches and submit pull request to merge them into the development branch (this is controlled by the CESNI/TI secretariat)
